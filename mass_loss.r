# The first step of my analysis is to calculate the percentage mass loss from the litter in the litterbags and the tea in the teabags (green and rooibos)

# No common garden, only data from the sites
# For the teas, initial and final weight without the bag are used



library(ggplot2)

setwd("C:/internship/")     # Same version is also on RStudio
